# ctypes

This is a small and simple header file that I find myself using in all my C projects.
It offers a terse naming scheme for fixed size C types without including `stdint.h` and `stdbool.h`.

## How to use?

Just `#include <ctypes.h>` and you are good to go.

## Supported Platforms

I'm using this header on *Windows* and it just works.
I have yet to test it on other platforms.
